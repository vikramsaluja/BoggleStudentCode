I started to think about if it would be better for me to use BFS or DFS and I decided because I want to look through each subtree at a time first that I should use DFS. I also spent this time rewriting my TST class from a previous problem set and i made some changes. |

I focused on inserting all dictionary words into the TST and using a full word kind of  lookup to check whether a generated string was a valid word or not.  This allowed me to verify and check for correctness but DFS continued even when the current prefix could not possibly lead to a dictionary word. I had a working DFS and could find words on the board but I am still trying to think about how to optimize my solution. |
| Jan 11  | 4:10-5:10om | During this time I completed the problem set. I tried to slightly optimize my DFS by using the prefix to match the expected constratints. The main imporvement and way that my thinking changed was that I realized that I could use the hasPrefix method to instead of checking wheater a completed string was in the dictionary, I could not determine early whether the current partial word was a prefix of any dictionary word. This came to mind as it is how a human would look through a dictionary and I tried to relfect my own thinking in real life into code.  |
